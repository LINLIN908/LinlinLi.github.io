I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Learning Sciences at McGill University, supervised by [Dr. Maria Cutumisu](https://www.mcgill.ca/education/maria-cutumisu) in the [Assessment of Learning and Transfer (ALERT) Lab](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/alertlab). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Qingdao University, China, where I later worked as a full-time university counselor at Student Affairs Department for two years. I then earned a Master’s degree in Education under the supervision of [Dr. Xinghua Wang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=IGn7oooAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), also at Qingdao University.

My doctoral research lies at the intersection of educational psychology and computer science, with a focus on leveraging recent advances in machine learning and educational data mining to enhance computational thinking and promote deeper learning outcomes. I am also interested in examining the effects of generative AI on education, particularly in the area of AI-driven personalized feedback. The overarching goal of 
my research is to advance machine learning methods in educational research and to positively impact teaching, learning, and assessment across diverse educational contexts.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Education at Normal College, Qingdao University, advised by Professor Xinghua Wang. Prior to this, I worked as a full-time university counsellor at Student Affairs Department of Qingdao University. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, also from Qingdao University.

My research focuses on the effectiveness of social robots in enhancing children's development across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and social domains. Furthermore, I delve into the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICT)-enhanced education, and the dark side of them (i.e., technostress). In addition, I use Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology to explore the internal brain mechanisms underlying children's cognitive and affective development as they engage with artificial intelligence (AI).
